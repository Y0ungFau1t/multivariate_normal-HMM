# multivariate_normal-HMM
A HMM model based on multivariate normal assumption on the observable given hidden states. 

## HMM.py
emission matrix

Vitebi algorithm

## Baum_Welch.py
scaled forward

scaled backward

Baum Welch algorithm

## generate.py
We use this to creat artifitial dataset to try out the algorithm

## branch `C`
We use C code to improve the training speed.

## reference
hamzarawal's repository helped me a lot at the starting point.
